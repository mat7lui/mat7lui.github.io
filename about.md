### Personal Information
I was born and raised in Georgia, but I currently reside in the NYC area. I live with my wife and two dogs, the latter of whom serve as my ever-present work companions as I work remotely (more details below). I'm devoted fan of Liverpool F.C. and also the University of Georgia (my alma mater). I'm a big fan of rock and classical music and believe myself to be a somewhat capable drummer, despite never owning a kit myself - hooray for knees and ADHD!

I am curious by nature and enjoy learning new things. Whether it's something adjacent to my career field or something completely unrelated, I'm naturally drawn to people with deep expertise in any subject matter and enjoy listening to lectures/discussions on various topics. To that end, I'm addicted to podcasts and am always in the market for good recommendations.

### Professional Information
 I work as a Data Analyst in the mental-healthcare space. I'm very passionate about finding ways to use data to improve the lives of others. In my time as an analyst, I've developed skills in data migration (using various APIs), cleaning, analysis, modeling, visualization, and presentation. I'm very much a Python fanatic and have spent more than 5 years using Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Bokeh, Scikit-Learn, and other libraries to ask questions and seek answers in service of helping others. In addition to Python, I work extensively with Microsoft Excel - everything from basic data manipulation, pivot tables, and formulas to VBA scripting and User Form design.

I'm currently working to broaden my abilities in the world of machine-learning in order to use the ever-growing potential of technology for the benefit of those struggling with mental illness. As a diploma candidate in the Data Science program at BrainStation, I'm hoping to go beyond simply looking into the past for insight from data. I want to leverage the past, to understand the present, and attempt to project the future.
